# 💹 PairTraderEngine – Statistical Arbitrage Backtesting in C++

---

## 🔹 Overview

**PairTraderEngine** is a modular **C++ application** implementing a **statistical arbitrage (pairs trading) strategy** for financial assets.

It allows users to:

* Load historical market data
* Compute hedge ratios
* Analyze spreads and generate Z-scores
* Backtest trading strategies on ETFs like **QQQ** and **XLK**

This project demonstrates **quantitative finance knowledge**, **C++ software engineering skills**, and **data-driven decision making**, making it a strong portfolio addition or SOP showcase.

---

## 🛠 Features

### 📄 CSV Data Loader

* Load historical price data from CSV files
* Supports flexible file paths (Windows/macOS/Linux)
* Extracts only the **closing prices** needed for backtesting
* Modularized in `csv_loader.h/cpp` for reuse in other projects

### 📊 Hedge Ratio Calculation

* Computes the optimal **hedge ratio (beta)** between two assets using linear regression
* Encapsulated in `ou_process.h/cpp`
* Supports real-time adjustment for new datasets

### 🔗 Spread and Z-Score Computation

* Calculates the **spread** between two correlated assets using the hedge ratio
* Computes **Z-scores** to identify trading signals (entry/exit points)
* Enables statistical arbitrage based on mean-reversion principles

### 💹 Backtesting Engine

* Fully modular `trade_engine.h/cpp`
* Inputs: asset prices, hedge ratio, lookback period, entry/exit thresholds
* Outputs: **cumulative P\&L**, **number of trades**, **equity curve**, and detailed trade results
* Supports parameter customization for experimentation and strategy optimization

### 🖥 Optional GUI with Qt

* Minimal Qt GUI implemented (if included)
* Allows selection of QQQ & XLK CSV files via **file dialogs**
* **Run Backtest** button executes the strategy
* Results displayed in a **text box**
* Optional equity curve plotting with Qt Charts or QCustomPlot

```

4. If using GUI, launch via Qt application:

```bash
./PairTraderQt.exe
```

## 🧩 Technical Highlights

* **C++17** for modern features and performance
* Modular design for **CSV loading**, **OU process**, **trade engine**
* Handles **dynamic datasets** with variable length
* Optional GUI with **Qt** for interactive backtesting
* Ready for **portfolio or SOP showcase**

This version will render **big, clear headers** on GitHub with emojis, and **bullet points are properly formatted**, so nothing disappears.

If you want, I can also **add a “How it works” diagram and explain the 5 key functions** visually in the README—it’ll make it much more impressive for admissions or GitHub visitors.

Do you want me to do that?
